Located on the
Deccan Plateau
, at a height of over 900 m (3,000 ft) above sea level, Bangalore has a pleasant climate throughout the year, with its parks and green spaces earning it the reputation of India's "Garden City".
[
12
]
Its elevation is the highest of India's major cities.
[
13
]
The city's history dates back to around 890, as per the old Kannada stone inscription found at the
Nageshwara Temple
in
Begur, Bangalore
. In 1537,
Kempé Gowdā
, a feudal ruler under the
Vijayanagara Empire
, established a
mud fort
, considered the foundation of modern Bangalore and its oldest areas, or
pétés
, which still exist. After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, Kempe Gowda declared independence; in 1638, a large
Adil Shahi
Bijapur army defeated Kempe Gowda III, and Bangalore came under
Shahaji Bhonsle
as a
jagir
, which later became his capital. The
Mughals
later captured Bangalore and sold it to
Maharaja
Devaraja Wodeyar II
of the
Kingdom of Mysore
.
[
14
]
When
Haider Ali
seized control of the kingdom, Bangalore's administration passed into his hands.
The city was captured by the
British East India Company
after victory in the
Fourth Anglo-Mysore War
(1799), which then returned administrative control of the city, along with the kingdom, to Maharaja
Krishnaraja Wadiyar III
. The old city developed under the dominions of the maharaja. In 1809, the British shifted their
cantonment
to Bangalore, outside the old city, and a town grew up around it. Following
India's independence
in 1947, Bangalore became the capital of
Mysore State
, and remained the capital when the state was
enlarged and unified
in 1956 and renamed Karnataka in 1973. The two urban settlements of Bangalore, the
town
and the cantonment, which had developed as independent entities, merged into a single urban centre in 1949. The existing
Kannada
name,
Bengalūru
, was declared the city's
official name
in 2006.
Bangalore is considered to be one of the fastest-growing global major metropolises.
[
15
]
[
16
]
Recent estimates of the
metro economy
of its urban area has ranked Bangalore as one of the
most productive metro areas
of India.
[
17
]
[
18
]
The city is considered the pivot for high-technology-based heavy manufacturing industry, with numerous large multinational technology corporations setting up their headquarters there. It is home to many top-tier engineering and research institutions. Bangalore is known as the "Silicon Valley of India" because it is the nation's leading
software
exporter as well as a major semiconductor hub.
[
19
]
Several state-owned
aerospace
and
defence organisations
are in the city. The presence of numerous notable sporting arenas in Bangalore makes it one of the country's sporting hubs.
Etymology
Bangalore
is an
anglicised
version of the city's
Kannada
name
Bengalūru
. It was the name of a village near Kodigehalli in Bangalore city today and was used by
Kempe Gowda
to name the city as Bangalore at the time of its foundation in 1537. The earliest reference to the name "Bengalūru" was found in a ninth-century
Western Ganga dynasty
stone inscription on a
vīra gallu
(Kannada:
ವೀರಗಲ್ಲು
;
lit.
'
hero stone
'
, a rock edict extolling the virtues of a warrior). According to an Old Kannada inscription found in
Begur
, "Bengalūrū" was the place of a battle in 890
CE
.
[
20
]
[
21
]
It was also referred to as "Kalyānapura" or "Kalyānapuri" ("Auspicious City") and "Dēvarāyanagara" during the
Vijayanagara
times.
[
22
]
An
apocryphal
story states that the twelfth-century
Hoysala
king
Veera Ballala II
, while on a hunting expedition, lost his way in the forest. Tired and hungry, he came across a poor old woman who served him boiled beans. The grateful king named the place "Benda-Kaal-uru" (literally, "town of boiled beans"), which eventually evolved into "Bengalūru".
[
20
]
[
23
]
[
24
]
Suryanath Kamath
has put forward an explanation of a possible floral origin of the name as derived from
benga
, the Kannada term for
Pterocarpus marsupium
(also known as the Indian Kino Tree), a species of dry and moist
deciduous trees
that grows abundantly in the region.
[
25
]
On 11 December 2005, the
Government of Karnataka
accepted a proposal by
Jnanpith Award
winner
U. R. Ananthamurthy
to
rename
Bangalore to
Bengalūru
.
[
26
]
On 27 September 2006, the
Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike
(BBMP) passed a resolution to implement the name change.
[
27
]
The government of Karnataka accepted the proposal and it was decided to officially implement the name change from 1 November 2006.
[
28
]
[
29
]
The
Union government
approved this request, along with name changes for 11 other Karnataka cities, in October 2014. Hence, Bangalore was renamed to "Bengaluru" on 1 November 2014.

History
Main article:
History of Bangalore
Early and medieval history
The Begur
Nageshwara Temple
was built in Bangalore around
c.
860
, during the reign of the
Western Ganga dynasty
.
Dodda Basavana Gudi
A discovery of
Stone Age
artefacts during the
2001 Census of India
at
Jalahalli
, Sidhapura and Jadigenahalli, all of which are located on Bangalore's outskirts today, suggest human settlement around 4000 BCE.
[
32
]
Around 1,000 BCE (during the
Iron Age
), burial grounds were established at
Koramangala
and
Chikkajala
on the outskirts of Bangalore. Coins of the
Roman emperors
Augustus
,
Tiberius
, and
Claudius
found at
Yeswanthpur
and
HAL Airport
indicate that the region was involved in trans-oceanic trade with the
Romans
and other civilisations in 27 BCE.
[
33
]
The region of modern-day Bangalore was part of several successive
South Indian
kingdoms. Between the fourth and tenth centuries, the region was ruled by the
Western Ganga dynasty
of Karnataka, the first dynasty to set up effective control over the region.
[
34
]
According to
Edgar Thurston
, there were twenty-eight kings who ruled Gangavadi from the start of the Christian era until its conquest by the Cholas. The
Western Gangas
ruled the region initially as a sovereign power (350–550 CE), and later as feudatories of the
Chalukyas of Badami
, followed by the
Rashtrakutas
until the tenth century.
[
25
]
The Begur
Nageshwara Temple
was commissioned around 860, during the reign of the Western Ganga King Ereganga Nitimarga I, and extended by his successor Nitimarga II.
[
35
]
[
36
]
Around 1004, during the reign of
Raja Raja Chola I
, the
Cholas
defeated the Western Gangas under the command of the crown prince
Rajendra Chola I
, and captured Bangalore.
[
35
]
[
37
]
During this period, the Bangalore region witnessed the migration of many groups—warriors, administrators, traders, artisans, pastorals, cultivators, and religious personnel from
Tamil Nadu
and other Kannada-speaking regions.
[
34
]
The
Chokkanathaswamy temple
at
Domlur
, the Aigandapura complex near
Hesaraghatta
,
Mukthi Natheshwara Temple
at Binnamangala, Choleshwara Temple at
Begur
,
Someshwara Temple
at
Ulsoor
, date from the
Chola
era.
[
35
]
In 1117, the
Hoysala
king
Vishnuvardhana
defeated the Cholas in the Battle of Talakad in south Karnataka, and extended its rule over the region.
[
35
]
Vishnuvardhana expelled the Cholas from all parts of the Mysore state.
[
38
]
By the end of the 13th century, Bangalore became a source of contention between two warring cousins, the Hoysala ruler
Veera Ballala III
of
Halebidu
and Ramanatha, who administered from the Hoysala held territory in Tamil Nadu.
[
35
]
Veera Ballala III had appointed a civic head at Hudi (now within Bangalore Municipal Corporation limits), thus promoting the village to the status of a town. After Veera Ballala III's death in 1343, the next empire to rule the region was the
Vijayanagara Empire
, which itself saw the rise of four dynasties, the
Sangamas
(1336–1485), the
Saluvas
(1485–1491), the
Tuluvas
(1491–1565), and the
Aravidu
(1565–1646).
[
39
]
During the reign of the Vijayanagara Empire,
Achyuta Deva Raya
of the
Tuluva dynasty
raised the
Shivasamudra Dam
across the
Arkavati
river at
Hesaraghatta
, whose reservoir is the present city's supply of regular piped water.

Foundation and early modern history
Bangalore Fort in 1860 showing fortifications and barracks. The fort was originally built by
Kempe Gowda I
as a mud fort in 1537.
Bangalore Palace
, built in 1887 in
Tudor architectural style
was modelled on
Windsor Castle
in England.
[
41
]
Modern Bangalore was begun in 1537 by the
chieftain
Kempe Gowda I
, who aligned with the
Vijayanagara Empire
under Emperor
Achyuta Deva Raya
to campaign against Gangaraja (whom he defeated and expelled to Kanchi), and who built
a mud-brick fort
for the people at the site that would become the central part of modern Bangalore. Kempe Gowda was restricted by rules made by the Emperor, who feared the potential power of Kempe Gowda and did not allow a stone fort. Kempe Gowda referred to the new town as his "
gandubhūmi
" or "Land of Heroes".
[
24
]
Within the fort, the town was divided into smaller divisions, each called a
pētē
(
Kannada pronunciation:
[peːteː]
).

The town had two main streets—Chikkapētē Street and Doddapētē Street.
[
43
]
Their intersection formed the Doddapētē Square—the heart of Bangalore. Kempe Gowda I's During the Vijayanagara rule, many saints and poets referred to Bangalore as "Devarāyanagara" and "Kalyānapura" or "Kalyānapuri" ("Auspicious City").
[
44
]
After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565 in the
Battle of Talikota
, Kempe Gowda I declared independence. His successor, Kempe Gowda II, built four towers that marked Bangalore's boundary.
[
45
]
Then in 1638, a large
Adil Shahi
Bijapur army led by Ranadulla Khan and accompanied by his second in command
Shāhji Bhōnslē
defeated Kempe Gowda III, and Bangalore was given to Shāhji as a
jagir
(feudal estate). Around 1639, he ordered the reconstruction of the destroyed city and the building of new lakes to solve the water shortage in the region.
[
44
]
In 1687, the
Mughal
general Kasim Khan, under orders from
Aurangzeb
, defeated
Ekoji I
, son of Shāhji, and sold Bangalore to
Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar
(1673–1704), the then ruler of the
Kingdom of Mysore
for three lakh rupees.
[
14
]
After the death of Krishnaraja Wodeyar II in 1759,
Hyder Ali
, Commander-in-Chief of the Mysore Army, proclaimed himself the
de facto
ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore. Hyder Ali is credited with building the Delhi and Mysore gates at the northern and southern ends of the city in 1760.
[
46
]
The kingdom later passed to Hyder Ali's son
Tipu Sultan
. Hyder and Tipu directed the building of the
Lal Bagh
Botanical Gardens
in 1760.
[
47
]
Under them, Bangalore developed into a commercial and military centre of strategic importance.
[
44
]
The Bangalore fort was captured by
British forces
under
Lord Cornwallis
on 21 March 1791 during the
Third Anglo-Mysore War
and formed a centre for British resistance against Tipu Sultan.
[
48
]
Following Tipu's death in the
Fourth Anglo-Mysore War
(1799), the British returned administrative control of the Bangalore
pētē
to the
Maharaja of Mysore
and was incorporated into the
Princely State of Mysore
, which existed as a nominally sovereign entity of the
British Raj
. The
old
pētē
developed in the dominions of the Maharaja of Mysore. The
Residency of Mysore State
was first established in
Mysore
City in 1799 and later shifted to Bangalore in 1804.
[
49
]
It was abolished in 1843,
[
49
]
only to be revived in 1881 at Bangalore and closed down permanently in 1947, with
Indian independence
.
[
50
]
The British found Bangalore to be a pleasant and appropriate place to station their
garrison
and therefore moved their cantonment to Bangalore from
Seringapatam
in 1809 near
Ulsoor
, about 6 km (4 mi) northeast of the city. A town grew up around the cantonment, by absorbing several villages in the area. The new centre had its own municipal and administrative apparatus, though technically it was a British enclave within the territory of the Wodeyar Kings of the Princely State of
Mysore
.
[
51
]
Two important developments which contributed to the rapid growth of the city, include the introduction of telegraph connections to all major Indian cities in 1853 and a rail connection to
Madras
(now Chennai), in 1864.

In the 19th century, Bangalore essentially became a
twin city
, with the "pētē", whose residents were predominantly
Kannadigas
and the cantonment created by the British.
[
53
]
Throughout the 19th century, the Cantonment gradually expanded and acquired a distinct cultural and political salience as it was governed directly by the British and was known as the Civil and Military Station of Bangalore. While it remained in the princely territory of Mysore, Cantonment had a large military presence and a cosmopolitan
civilian
population that came from outside the princely state of Mysore, including British and
Anglo-Indians
army officers.
[
54
]
Bangalore was hit by a
plague
epidemic in 1898 that claimed nearly 3,500 lives. The crisis caused by the outbreak catalysed the city's sanitation process. Telephone lines were laid to help co-ordinate anti-plague operations. Regulations for building new houses with proper sanitation facilities came into effect. A health officer was appointed and the city divided into four wards for better co-ordination.
Victoria Hospital
was inaugurated in 1900 by
Lord Curzon
, the then
Governor-General of British India
.
[
55
]
New extensions in
Malleswaram
and
Basavanagudi
were developed in the north and south of the pētē.
[
56
]
In 1903, motor vehicles came to be introduced in Bangalore.
[
57
]
In 1906, Bangalore became one of the first cities in India to have electricity from
hydro power
, powered by the
hydroelectric
plant situated in
Shivanasamudra
.
[
58
]
The
Indian Institute of Science
was established in 1909, which subsequently played a major role in developing the city as a science research hub.
[
59
]
In 1912, the
Bangalore torpedo
, an offensive explosive weapon widely used in
World War I
and
World War II
, was devised in Bangalore by
British army officer
Captain McClintock of the
Madras Sappers and Miners
.
[
60
]
Bangalore's reputation as the "Garden City of India" began in 1927 with the
silver jubilee
celebrations of the rule of
Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV
. Several projects such as the construction of parks, public buildings and hospitals were instituted to improve the city.
[
61
]
Bangalore played an important role during the
Indian independence movement
.
Mahatma Gandhi
visited the city in 1927 and 1934 and addressed public meetings here.
[
33
]
In 1926, the
labour unrest
in
Binny Mills
due to demand by textile workers for payment of bonus resulted in
lathi charging
and police firing, resulting in the death of four workers, and several injuries.
[
62
]
In July 1928, there were notable
communal disturbances
in Bangalore, like when a
Ganesh
idol was removed from a school compound in the Sultanpet area of Bangalore.
[
63
]
In 1940, the first flight between Bangalore and
Bombay
took off, which placed the city on India's urban map.
[
59
]
After India's independence in August 1947, Bangalore remained in the newly carved
Mysore State
of which the Maharaja of Mysore was the
Rajapramukh
(appointed governor).
[
64
]
The "City Improvement Trust" was formed in 1945, and in 1949, the "City" and the "Cantonment" merged to form the
Bangalore City Corporation
.
[
65
]
The
Government of Karnataka
later constituted the
Bangalore Development Authority
in 1976 to coordinate the activities of these two bodies.
[
66
]
Public sector employment and education provided opportunities for Kannadigas from the rest of the state to migrate to the city. Bangalore experienced rapid growth in the decades 1941–51 and 1971–81, which saw the arrival of many immigrants from northern Karnataka. The
Government of India
set up the
All India Institute of Mental Health
(AIIMH) in 1956. By 1961, Bangalore had become the sixth-largest city in India, with a population of 1,207,000.
[
44
]
In the following decades, Bangalore's manufacturing base continued to expand with the establishment of private companies such as
MICO
(Motor Industries Company), which set up its manufacturing plant in the city.
[
67
]
[
68
]
By the 1980s, urbanisation had spilled over the current boundaries, and in 1986, the
Bangalore Metropolitan Region Development Authority
, was established to co-ordinate the development of the entire region as a single unit.
[

]
On 8 February 1981, a
major fire broke out
at Venus Circus in Bangalore, where more than 92 people died, the majority of them children.
[
69
]
Bangalore experienced a growth in its real estate market in the 1980s and 1990s, spurred by capital investors from other parts of the country who converted Bangalore's large plots and colonial
bungalows
into multi-storied apartments.
[
70
]
In 1985,
Texas Instruments
became the first
multinational corporation
to set up base in Bangalore. Other information technology companies followed suit and by the end of the 20th century, Bangalore had established itself as the
Silicon Valley
of India

Geography
Main article:
Bangalore geography and environment
The
Hesaraghatta Lake
in Bangalore
Bangalore lies in the southeast of the
South Indian
state of Karnataka. It is in the heart of the
Mysore Plateau
(a region of the larger
Cretaceous
Deccan Plateau
) at an average elevation of 900 m (2,953 ft).
[
75
]
: 8
It covers an area of 741 km
2
(286 sq mi).
[
76
]
The majority of the city of Bangalore lies in the
Bangalore Urban district
of Karnataka and the surrounding rural areas are a part of the
Bangalore Rural district
. The Government of Karnataka has carved out the new district of
Ramanagara
from the old Bangalore Rural district.
[
77
]
Bangalore's topography is generally flat, although the western parts of the city are hilly. The highest point is
Vidyaranyapura
Doddabettahalli
, 962 m (3,156 ft) above sea level, situated to the northwest of the city.
[
78
]
No major rivers run through the city, although the
Arkavathi
and
South Pennar
cross paths at the
Nandi Hills
, 60 km (37 mi) to the north.
River Vrishabhavathi
, a minor tributary of the Arkavathi, arises within the city at Basavanagudi and flows through the city. The rivers Arkavathi and Vrishabhavathi together carry much of Bangalore's
sewage
.
[
79
]
[
80
]
A
sewerage
system, constructed in 1922, covers 215 km
2
(83 sq mi) of the city and connects with five
sewage treatment
centres located in the city's periphery.
[
81
]
In the 16th century, Kempe Gowda I constructed many lakes to meet the town's water requirements. The Kempambudhi Kere, since overrun by modern development, was prominent among those lakes. In the first half of the 20th century, the Nandi Hills
waterworks
were commissioned by
Sir Mirza Ismail
(
Diwan
of Mysore, 1926–41 CE) to provide a water supply to the city.
Kaveri
River flows about 60 miles (100 km) from the city of Bengaluru,
[
82
]
and the river
Kaveri
provides around 80% of the city's water supply and the remaining 20% is obtained from the Thippagondanahalli and Hesaraghatta reservoirs of the Arkavathi river.
[
83
]
Bangalore receives 800 million litres (210 million US gallons) of water a day, more than any other Indian city,
[
84
]
but Bangalore does face occasional water shortages, especially during summer and in years with low rainfall.
[
85
]
A
random sampling
of the
air quality index
(AQI) of twenty stations within the city ranged from 76 to 314, suggesting heavy to severe air pollution around areas of high traffic.
[
86
]
Bangalore has a handful of freshwater lakes and
water tanks
, the largest of which are Madivala tank,
Hebbal Lake
,
Ulsoor
Lake, Yediyur Lake and
Sankey Tank
. However, about 90% of Bangalore's lakes are polluted;

Groundwater occurs in
silty
to
sandy
layers of the
alluvial
sediments. The
Peninsular Gneissic
Complex (PGC) is the most dominant rock unit in the area and includes
granites
,
gneisses
and
migmatites
, while the soils of Bangalore consist of red
laterite
and red, fine
loamy
to
clayey
soils.
[
86
]
The city's vegetation is mostly large
deciduous
canopy
and some
coconut
trees.
[
91
]
Many trees are frequently felled to pave way for infrastructure development.
[
92

Though Bangalore has been classified as a part of the seismic zone II (a stable zone), it has experienced
earthquakes
of magnitude as high as 4.5 on the
Richter scale
.
[
94
]
Climate
Bangalore has a
tropical savanna climate
(
Köppen climate classification
Aw
) with distinct
wet
and
dry
seasons. Due to its high elevation, Bangalore usually enjoys a more moderate climate throughout the year, although occasional
heat waves
can make summer somewhat uncomfortable.
[
95
]
The coolest month is January with an average low temperature of 15.1 °C (59.2 °F) and the hottest month is April with an average high of 34.1 °C (93.4 °F).
[
96
]
The highest temperature ever recorded in Bangalore is 39.2 °C (103 °F), recorded 24 April 2016, corresponding with
the strong El Niño
in that year.
[
97
]
The lowest ever recorded is 7.8 °C (46 °F) in January 1884.
[
98
]
[
99
]
Winter temperatures rarely drop below 14 °C (57 °F), and summer temperatures seldom exceed 36 °C (97 °F). Bangalore receives rainfall from both the northeast and the southwest
monsoons
, and the wettest months is September, followed by October and August.
[
96
]
The summer heat is moderated by fairly frequent
thunderstorms
, which occasionally cause power outages and local flooding. Most of the rainfall occurs during the late afternoon or evening and rain before noon is infrequent. November 2015 (290.4 mm) was recorded as one of the wettest months in Bangalore with heavy rains causing severe flooding in some areas, and closure of a number of organisations for over a couple of days.
[
100
]
The heaviest rainfall recorded in a 24-hour period is 179 mm (7 in) recorded on 1 October 1997.
[
101
]
In 2022, Bangalore faced a large amount of rainfall, which was 368% more than the yearly average.
[
102
]
Several areas were flooded, and power supply was also cut off.

The
Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike
(BBMP,
Greater Bangalore Municipal Corporation

The BBMP is run by a city council of 250 members, including 198
corporators
representing each of the
wards
of the city and 52 other elected representatives, consisting of members of Parliament and the state legislature. Elections to the council are held once every five years and are decided by
popular vote
. Members contesting elections to the council usually represent one or more of the state's political parties. A mayor and deputy mayor are also elected from the elected members of the council.

Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike
(
BBMP
) is the administrative body responsible for civic amenities and some infrastructural assets of the
Greater Bengaluru
metropolitan area.
[
2
]
It is the fourth
largest Municipal Corporation in India
and is responsible for a population of 8.4 million in an area of 741 km
2
. Its boundaries have expanded more than 10 times over the last six decades.
[
3
]
Its roles and responsibilities include the "orderly development of the city" —
zoning
and building regulations, health,
hygiene
, licensing, trade and education, as well as
quality of life
issues such as public open space,
water bodies
, parks and
greenery
.
The BBMP represents the
third level of government
(the Central Government and
State Government
being the first two levels). BBMP is run by a city council composed of elected
representatives
, called "corporators", one from each of the wards (localities) of the city. A range of other statutory authorities exercise certain municipal responsibilities (eg: the
Bangalore Development Authority
, and
BESCOM
).
The elections to the council are held once every five years, with results being decided by
popular vote
. The members contesting elections to the council represent one or more of the state's
political parties
.
History
[
edit
]
The history of municipal governance of Bangalore dates back to 27 March 1862, when nine leading citizens of the old city formed a Municipal Board under the Improvement of Towns Act of 1850 with a similar Municipal Board formed for the newer
Cantonment
area.
[
4
]
The two boards were legalised in 1881, and functioned as two independent bodies called Bangalore City Municipality and Bangalore Civil and Military Station Municipality (Cantonment).  The following year, half of the municipal councillors were permitted to be elected,
property tax
was introduced and greater powers given over police and local improvement.
[
4
]
In 1913 an honorary president was introduced, and seven years later made an elected position. An appointed Municipal Commissioner was introduced in 1926 on the Cantonment board as the executive authority.
After
Indian independence
, the two Municipal Boards were merged to form the Corporation of the City of Bangalore in 1949, under the Bangalore City Corporation Act. The corporation then consisted of 70 elected representatives and 50 electoral divisions and the office of Mayor introduced for the first time. The first elections were held in 1950.
The name of the council changed — first to Bangalore City Corporation (BCC) and then to Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BMP) in the year 1989.
[

[

[

[

]
In 1989, the BMP expanded to include 87 wards and further increased to 100 wards in 1995, covering an extra area of 75 sq. km. The council also included 40 additional members drawn from the parliament and the state legislature.
[
9
]
[
10
]
Around the same time, the BMP council passed a resolution that only BDA layouts should be included in its limits and not revenue pockets
[
clarification needed
]
, because of the cost of developing the latter. Around 50 per cent of the expanded BMP areas (meaning at least 40 wards among 100) were revenue pockets at that time. At that time, the BMP proposed betterment charges of Rs.215/sq. yard based on costs of developing those areas. But after the BMP elections of 1996, the council took a decision to reduce betterment charges to Rs.100/sq. yard. The state government (the
H. D. Deve Gowda
led administration
) then issued a notice to the city council demanding why the latter reduced the rates. Subsequently, the state government agreed to the BMP rates.
[
11
]
In November 2006, the BMP Council was dissolved by the state government upon the completion of its five-year term. In January 2007, the
Karnataka Government
issued a notification to merge 100 wards of the erstwhile Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike with seven
City Municipal Councils (CMC)s
, one
Town Municipal Council (TMC)
and 110 villages around the city to form a single administrative area
[
12
]
(111 villages mentioned in initial Notification. Later 2 villages omitted from the list and another village added before final Notification).
[
13
]
The process was completed by April 2007 and the body was renamed 'Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (Greater Bangalore Municipal Corporation).
The first elections to the newly created BBMP body were held on 28 March 2010, after the delays due to the
delimitation
of wards and finalising voter lists.
The second elections were held on 22 August 2015 with the BJP winning the majority with 101 Corporators (Congress won 76, Janatha Dal S 14 and Independents 7). The results were declared on 25 August 2015. With none of the parties touching the required number, the Congress and JDS with the help of independents won the mayor election. The BJP with the majority number of corporators in the BBMP council was forced to sit in the Opposition. 
On 11 September 2015, B.N. Manjunatha Reddy of the INC was elected Mayor, Hemalatha Gopalaiah of the
JD(S)
was elected Deputy Mayor and Padmanabha Reddy of the BJP was elected the Leader of Opposition.
Elections were held in Mar–April 2010 after a period of Commissioner's rule
[
14
]
[
15
]
for the BBMP corporators and a Mayor S. K. Nataraj was chosen.
Fresh elections were held in August 2015.
In 2015 the
INC
passed a legislation in
the state parliament
[
16
]
requiring the abolition of the BBMP, and its reconstitution as multiple, separate municipal bodies.
[
17
]
The government's rationale, as stated in the bill itself, was that the population of Bangalore was too large for a single corporation to administer.
[
18
]
The bill recommended that the BBMP be split into three separate municipal corporations ("trifurcation"), but stated the actual number was to be specified by government notification at a later date. The bill was strongly opposed by the opposition in the state parliament
[
19
]
and a majority of the BBMP councillors.
[
20
]
It was also debated in the media.
[
21
]
[
22
]
Commentators noted that the bill takes place against the failure of municipal trifurcation in Delhi three years earlier.
[
18
]
[
23
]
[
24
]
In July 2016, the Union Government's
Ministry of Home Affairs
raised 13 objections to the bill, and sent a request for further explanation to
the Karnataka Government
, in particular raising the point that an elected body cannot be dissolved before its term ends, leaving the BBMP intact until at least 2019.
[
25
]
It also advised Karnataka to study the consequences of the Delhi trifurcation as it may relate to Bangalore. After holding off on implementing the split for several years, in October 2017, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah reaffirmed his objective of carrying out the trifurcation.
[
26
]
The
Karnataka Legislative Assembly
passed the Karnataka Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Bill to increase the number of civic wards in Bengaluru to 250.
[
27
]
On 6 October 2020 a legislative select committee led by BJP MLA S Raghu decided to increase the number of civic wards from 198 to 243, Chief Minister
B. S. Yediyurappa
approved creating 243 wards. Delimitation Commission, headed by BBMP Commissioner Manjunath Prasad, was set up to decide on how to divide the city into 243 wards. The Delimitation Commission consists of Bengaluru Urban Deputy Commissioner, BDA (Bangalore Development Authority) Chairman and BBMP Special Commissioner Revenue (all IAS officers) as its members.
[
28
]
On 10 December 2020, the
B. S. Yediyurappa government
passed the
Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Bill, 2020
in the
Karnataka legislature
. The BBMP Act will govern the municipal corporation.
[
29
]
Various changes to the BBMP’s structure was incorporated in the new Act. The BBMP Act increased the term length for the mayor and the deputy mayor to five years from one year. It also increased the number of zones from eight to fifteen. All fifteen zones would be headed by a
zonal commissioner
who reports to the BBMP’s chief commissioner. The Act also forms
constituency consultative committees
(headed by the local MLA, consisting of councillors and resident association members) and
zonal committees
to monitor the implementation of projects and address public grievances.

A mayor and deputy mayor of the council are also elected for a period of 30 months, though not by popular vote. The post of the mayor and deputy mayor are filled through a
quota
system to a
Scheduled Castes and Tribes
candidate or to an
Other Backward Class
female candidate from among the elected Councillors
[1]
.
However, in the absence of an elected body, the BBMP is at present run by an Administrator and a Commissioner, who is appointed by the State Government. The Additional Commissioner is a specially appointed IRS officer. The Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike is responsible for the civic and infrastructural requirements of the city. It often works in conjunction with other civic bodies such as the
Agenda for Bangalore Infrastructure Development Task Force (ABIDE)
and the
Bangalore Development Authority (BDA)
to design and implement civic and infrastructural projects.

As per the BS Patil headed BBMP Restructuring Committee, BBMP is poised to be restructured into 5 smaller palikes functioning under Greater Bengaluru Authority. 
The present Gandhinagar zone as Central BMP, Dasarahalli, RR Nagar & Vijaynagar zones as West BMP, Yelahanka and Malleshwaram zones as North BMP, Sarvagnanagar & Mahadevapura as East BMP and finally Jayanagar & Bommanahalli zones as South BMP. 
Every zone has a Joint Commissioner, who is answerable to the BBMP commissioner. The decentralization hasn't been very effective in addressing the problems in administration. The end of 2013 saw discussions in various circles about dividing BBMP into more parts.
Therefore, once President's approval to the BBMP Restructuring is accorded, BBMP is to be split into 5 municipal corporations with 400 wards (80 each) and the current BBMP headquarters at NR Square becoming headquarters for the Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA) with five Mahanagara Palikes under it.
The GBA will have a Metropolitan Commissioner (IAS rank – higher administrative grade) and a directly elected Metropolitan Mayor (on the likes of London) with 5-year term.
Each palikes too will have a Mayor for 5 years.
As per Urban Development Department, 
Yalahanka and Malleshwara zones will form North Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, Gandhinagara zone into Central Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, Dasarahalli, Rajarajeshwari Nagara & Vijayanagara as West Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, Jayanagara & Bommanahalli as South Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike and Sarvagnanagara & Mahadevapura as East Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike.
This move will lead to better civic management, higher power and accountability, greater accessibility to citizens, solve logistical issues, higher tax compliance etc.
Income and expenditure
[
edit
]
The BBMP raises more than half if its annual income from the collection of property tax, a third from State government grants and the remainder received in Central government grants, direct service fees, licences (advertising hoardings) and rent from municipal owned property.

Role of the BBMP
[
edit
]
Property tax collection
[
edit
]
A shift to a unit area self assessment method of property tax collection in Bangalore was successful, leading to a sharp rise in tax collection revenues.
[
34
]
Phase one of the reforms starting in 2000 led to a 33 per cent increase in tax revenues, whilst a second phase initiated in 2007 led to a 74 per cent increase the following year.
Roads and infrastructure
[
edit
]
Bangalore contains approximately 1,920 km of arterial and sub-arterial roads. Roads are badly constructed, full of potholes and frequently dug up and re-laid. The Deccan Herald describes an "unholy nexus of corporators and contractors [...] benefiting from the lucrative business of filling potholes, relaying and asphalting roads annually".
[
35
]
The BBMP came under criticism in 2005 from Information Technology companies for failing to effectively address the crumbling road and traffic infrastructure of the city.
In July 2005, the
Karnataka High Court
castigated the BBMP for failing to maintain roads in good condition.
The BBMP's contracting system for the city's roads are reported to operate under a corrupt commission system.
[
36
]
When work is tendered and the bid won by a contractor, a percentage (perhaps up to 20%) is paid to the area corporator, MLA and BBMP council.
In 2015, artist Nanjundaswamy installed a life-size crocodile as a form of protest against 'killer' potholes.
[
37
]
[
38
]
This was followed a month later with the installation of a giant anaconda.
[
39
]
TenderSURE
[
edit
]
The redevelopment of Church Street under TenderSURE. This is the first road to be paved with granite cobblestones in Bangalore.
[
40
]
In 2011, the
Jana Urban Space Foundation
published a document called TenderSURE (Specification for Urban Roads Execution)
[
41
]
which contained detailed guidelines for the design, specifications and procurement contracts needed to bring India's road infrastructure up to an international standard within the Indian context. The purpose of these guidelines was to enable the construction of urban roads that were designed for all road users (cars, buses, autos, bikes, pedestrians, street carts), that integrated all existing networked services (water, sewerage, power, OFC, gas and drainage) with provision for the future, and that would integrate the civic agencies to prevent roads being repeatedly re-dug and relaid. The ultimate objective was to give roads a lifespan of 10 years, instead of the existing one or two.
In 2012, the Government of Karnataka made budget allocations for 20 pilot roads to be implemented by the BBMP.
[
42
]
[
43
]
The first of these roads, including St Marks and Museum Road, where completed in June 2015. Another 50 roads were sanctioned by the Government in the same year.
[
44
]
In 2017, St Marks Road became a case study for the Global Designing Cities Initiative's Global Urban Streets Guide,
[
45
]
making it the only model street selected from India.
[
46
]
Stormwater drains
[
edit
]
The BBMP reports that it administers 741 kilometres of storm water drains and another 1,500 km of secondary drains.
[
47
]
A large percentage of the Rs 600 crores allocated to the BBMP under the
JnNURM
scheme for repairs and upgrades of the city's storm water drains is reported to have been siphoned off, leading to a reduction in such funding from the central government.
[
18
]
Garbage disposal
[
edit
]
Rubbish is routinely dumped on the street in Bangalore.
Bangalore's waste volumes have grown strongly since 1990 and the BBMP has come under ongoing criticism for its mismanagement of the city's garbage disposal system,
[
48
]
particularly throughout 2012–13
[
49
]
when Bangalore was routinely referred to as "Garbage City".
[
50
]
Following the closure of Bangalore's two landfill sites in mid-2012 by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, the BBMP was left without any plan or alternative strategy for disposing of city's 3-4000 tons of daily waste.
[
51
]
[
52
]
Garbage worker strikes
[
53
]
and High Court rulings requiring the implementation of the Municipal Solid Waste Management Rules 2001 exacerbated the crisis whilst garbage accumulated on every street. The crisis abated somewhat from 2014.
A 2017 enquiry found no serious scrutiny of waste contractors, with the BBMP reimbursing contractors for around 200 crore in fake bills.
[
54
]
As of 2018, seven waste processing plants are reported to be operating at only one third of their capacity.
[
55
]
Public open space
[
edit
]
Bangalore contains more than 416 neighbourhood parks. Current Karnataka legislation requires 15% of residential layouts to be retained for public open space, and an additional 10% for civic amenities. However, within the area of the BBMP one study estimated that only 8.4% of the urban area is parkland whilst the 2003 Bangalore Master Plan allocated only 2.01 sq m of green space per citizen, 6.99 sq m less than the minimum recommendation of the World Health Organisation.
[
56
]
By way of comparison, the 'Urban Green Guidelines, 2014' issued by the Government of India calculates the average green space for cities worldwide at 18.6% and Bangalore's area of green space at less than 5%.
[
57
]
Bangalore compares unfavourably with
New Delhi
, which has retained 20% of its urban area as public open space. It also demonstrates a significant deterioration since the 1960, when open space represented 17.2% of the total area.
[
58
]
Tree planting
[
edit
]
A Gulmohar tree in Lalbagh Garden, Bangalore. Widely planted in the 1980s these trees are no longer used in the BBMP's
tree planting
schemes.
The BBMP's responsibilities include planting and maintaining street trees. The BBMP has embarked upon numerous tree planting schemes over many decades and with varying levels of success. The most notable period of planting is held to be the period of 1982 and 1987 when Chief Minister
R Gundu Rao
appointed forest officer S G Neginahal to green the streets of Bangalore with more than 15 lakh trees.
[
59
]
[
60
]
His systematic plantation program involved the establishment of new nurseries, the installation of tree guards, a five-year monitoring program and the replacement of any failed plantings.
[
61
]
The reported success rate was 97%
[
62
]
and most of the mature trees along Bangalore's major avenues date to this era.
More recently the BBMP has reported that between 2007 and 2013 more than 10 lakh trees have been planted with a survival rate of 64.5%.
[
62
]
These numbers have been contested by civic agencies and citizen groups as inaccurate. The Bangalore-based Environmental Support Group did a ground survey to calculate a survival rate of 20 – 25%, assuming the trees were even planted at all
[
62
]
whilst urban conservationist Vijay Nishanth estimates a survival rate of 10%.
[
63
]
The BBMP places responsibility for this with the lack experience of their contractors. Contractors in turn blame the BBMP for failure to release funds and allocating sapling locations in places with no water or suitable growing conditions.
In 2017 the High Court of Karnataka directed the BBMP to plant an additional 10 lakh street trees and to form greening committees comprising activists and experts, and tree wardens.
[
64
]
To comply with this directive the BBMP launched an app called 'BBMP Green'
[
65
]
allowing residents to collect free saplings and plant them on their own streets.
[
66
]
Activists criticised the program for essentially absolving the BBMP of the responsibility to maintain street trees within the city.
[
67
]
The BBMP's tree planting activities contrast unfavourably with the Forestry Department who plants half the number of trees per year at a lower cost and a reportedly 95% survival rate.
[
63
]
None of the BBMP's replanting schemes have compensated for the ongoing removal of existing trees within the city, both from private property and the destruction of previously planted street trees for street widening purposes. A 2010 study found the density of trees in Bangalore to be lower than many other Asian cities
[
68
]
with an estimated 50,000 trees lost between the date of publication and 2016.

Bengaluru Pete

Bangalore
city
[

]
which was established by
Kempegowda I
(c. 1510–1570) in 1537 with roads laid out in the cardinal directions, and entrance gates at the end of each road.
[
1
]
Kempegowda also termed the Pete he built as his "gandu bhoomi" or "Land of Heroes".  Pete (
Kannada
: Market centre) forms a well–defined body of markets which were associated with various trades and professions of the populace in the locality markets and given the names of trades pursued in such markets. The well known markets are the Tharagupete–market for grains, the Balepete – for
Bangles
and
musical instruments
, the Chikkapete and the Nagarthpete for textile trade, the Ballapurpete and the Ganigarapete market where oil is extracted by people of the
Ganiga
community, the Tigalarapete–flower market of
gardeners
, the Cubbonpete – textile manufacture by people of the
Devanga
community.

The Bengaluru Pete, established in 1537 around the Mud Fort, built by Kempe Gowda I as the nucleus, with an area of 2.24 square kilometres (1 sq mi), has expanded to the present sprawling city of 741 square kilometres (286 sq mi)  embracing a multi
ethnic
population of 5.7 million; as per
Census of India 2001
,
[
2
]
the present population is reported as 6.6 million (2007) and is thus known by the epithet  "the Boom city". The other nicknames of the city also reflect the growth direction of the city, such as the
Silicon Valley of India
, the "Fashion Capital of India," and "The Pub City of India."

The old Pete, structured in the contemporary style of deep networks of crowded streets, richly represented the multi cultural identity, social history, and economic
geography
of the times which are considered as a hallmark in the planning and design of any urban agglomerate. The place has left its mark on literature with novels like
Riddle of the Seventh Stone
[

being set in this part of Bangalore. These attributes have been further accentuated in the present day Bangalore city.

It is now the third largest metropolis in India,

the largest city in Karnataka state and the 28th largest city in the world.

History
[
edit
]
Even though historically Bengaluru is chronicled to the period of 900 AD, but with confirmed history of the Bengaluru Pete traced to 1537, when Kempe Gowda I (pictured), a Chieftain of the
Vijayanagara Empire
, widely held as the founder of modern Bangalore, built a mud fort and established the area around it as his province. He was the great-grandson of Jaya Gowda who established the Yelahankanada Prabhu clan, in 1418 AD, and whose principality was in
Yelahanka
, north of the present day Bangalore.
[
8
]
Kempegowda I, who showed remarkable qualities of leadership from his childhood, had a grand vision to build a new city which was further fueled by his visits to
Hampi
(now a
UNESCO
heritage city) the then beautiful capital city of the
Vijayanagar Empire
. He persevered with his vision and got permission from the King Achutaraya, the ruler of the empire, to build a new city for himself. The King gifted 12 hoblis (revenue subdivisions) with an annual income of 30,000 varahas (
gold coins
) to his Chieftain Kempegowda to meet the expenses of his venture of building a new city.
[

[

Kempegowda I, builder of
Bangalore
or Bengaluru pete, his statue opposite the Bangalore Corporation office
Kempegowda moved from his ancestral land of
Yelahanka
to establish his new
principality
, having obtained support from King Achutaraya. One version for the site selection process for the Bangalore Pete is that during a hunting expedition along with his advisor Gidde Gowda, he went westward of Yelahanka and reached a village called Shivasamudra (near
Hesaraghatta
) some 10 miles (16 km) from Yelahanka where, in a tranquil atmosphere under a tree, he visualised building a suitable city with a fort, a cantonment, tanks (water reservoirs), temples and people of all trades and professions to live in it for his future capital.  It is also said that an
omen
of an uncommon event of a
hare
chasing away a
hunter
dog at the place favoured selection of the place and a dream of goddess
Lakshmi
(Hindu Goddess of wealth) that prophesied good indications of the events to happen further sealed his decision on the place for his capital. Following this event, on an auspicious day in 1537 A.D., he conducted a ground breaking ritual and festivities by ploughing the land with four pairs of decorated white bulls in four directions, at the focal point of the junction of Doddapet and Chikkapet, the junction (pictured) of the present day
Avenue Road
and Old Taluk Kacheri Road (OTC).
[
9
]
[
10
]
The Doddapete (now called Avenue road) crossing with Chickpete
Thereafter, he constructed a
mud
fort
(now in the western part of the city), with a
moat
surrounding it, which had nine large gates. Building of the mud fort is also steeped in a legend which is a tragic but heroic story.  During the construction of the Fort it was said that the southern gate would fall off no sooner than it was built and human sacrifice was indicated to ward off the evil spirits. Kempe Gowda could not accept such a situation nor permit any such event to occur. But his daughter-in-law, Lakshamma, realising her father-in-Law's predicament, beheaded herself with a sword at the southern gate in the darkness of night. Thereafter, the fort was completed without any mishap. In her memory, Kempegowda built a temple in her name in
Koramangala
.
[
10
]
Thus, Kempegowda's dream fructified and the Bengaluru Pete evolved around the Mud fort called the
Bangalore Fort
. This mud fort (see infobox) was converted and enlarged into the present stone fort during Chikkadeva Raya
Wodeyar
's rule between 1673 AD – 1704 AD and
Hyder Ali
's rule, in 1761.
It has also been reported that
Guru Nanak
, the
1st Sikh
Guru
, on his way back from
Sri Lanka
halted at Bangalore. Kempegowda met him and sought his blessings.  Guru Nanak not only blessed Kempegowda but also advised him to develop the place.
[
11
]
The Pete
The Pete as built by Kempegowda I had two main streets, namely the Chikkapet Street, which ran east–west, and the Doddapet Street, which ran north–south. Their intersection formed the Doddapete Square (present Avenue road), the heart of Bangalore.
[
12
]
Halasoor, also called
Ulsoor
(east), Sondekoppa (west),
Yelahanka
(north), and
Anekal
(south) were the four gates erected at the cardinal directions. Five more gates were also built and these were named as
Varthur
,
Sarjapur
,
Kankanahalli
,
Kengeri
and Yeshwantapur gates. Relating the Pete to the present landmarks of the city, the following are mentioned:
The ancient
Hanuman
temple built by Kempegowdas at the Avenue road crossing
The fort extends from 'Binny Mill' in the west to the
Ulsoor
Police Station in the east, and from the
Anjaneya
Temple (pictured) near Mysore Bank in the north to Prof. Shivashankar Circle (near Fort High School) in the south.
The main street extends from Sunakkalpet Circle in the east to the Goodshed Road in the west and this stretch is now known as Old Taluk Kacheri Road.
The main street of the Pete from
Avenue Road
(Doddapete Road) in the north to Krishna Rajendra (KR) Road in the south.
[

]
Temples and lakes were planned and residential layouts, or agraharas (residential areas of
Brahmins
), around each temple were built during the rule of Kempegowda I, in and around the Pete, which along with the mud fort built by him, changed Bengaluru from a village to a centre of culture based on the
Hindu religion
. These developments were fashioned in the tradition of the
Vijayanagara
cities.  The montage of bazaars, temple complexes and agraharams in and around the Pete got a further fillip during the rule of Kempegowda II, who built four cardinal towers setting limits for the growth of the Bengaluru pete.
[
13
]
But the growth of Bengaluru has far outstripped these limits several-fold.
The visionary approach of the Kempe Gowdas, perceiving the needs of the growing population of the Pete, resulted in building a number of lakes/ponds (called 'Kere' in the Kannada language) and temples (some are pictured in the gallery) in and around the fort. Some of the notable ones are :
[
9
]
The lakes in the inner circle are the Kempe Gowda Agrahara, Siddikatte, Sampangi, Dharmambudhi, Kempambudhi kere, and Karanji.
The outer circle lakes were the Yediyur, Chennamma, Mavalli, Akki Thimmana halli, Jakkaraya kere. Most of the lakes have been encroached upon for the present urban needs.
The early temples built or improved were the
Gavi Gangadhareshwara Temple
, Nandi (
Bull Temple
) (Basavanna), Dodda
Ganapathi
, Karanji
Anjaneya
, Ulsoor Someswara, Koramangala
Lakshmi
,
Mahakali
, Veerabhadra,
Vinayaka
and Kalabhairava.
Pete expansion
With the decline of the rule of the Kempegowdas' clan, the
Maratha
rule and culture followed for some time. In 1638, Pete was conquered by
Bijapur Sultan
who ruled for the next 50 years. The
Mughals
took over in 1687 and leased the town and the surrounding areas to Chikkadeva Raya
Wodeyar
of the
Mysore Kingdom
, in 1690 AD. Chikkadeva Raya Wodeyar (1673 AD −1704 AD) built an oval shaped fort south of the old mud fort and after his death in 1704 AD, the rule of
Hyder Ali
and
Tippu Sultan
ensued until Tippu's death at the hands of the British in 1790 AD. It was Hyder Ali who rebuilt the mud Fort in stones.  During their reign, a palace called the Tippu's Palace was built at the South end of the fort and a
Hindu temple
for Lord
Srinivasa
was also built adjoining Tippu's Palace, which is called the "
Kote Venkataramana Temple
" or "Fort temple". At this stage, the old Pete had expanded to a circumference of  5 kilometres (3 mi) with prosperous, well laid out streets and flourishing shops [the market stretched from the north gate – the present Avenue road (pictured) – of the Pete to the oval fort]. A beautiful
botanical garden
called the
Lalbagh
was also built in 1760 AD. The Pete became not only a commercial centre but also a military centre of strategic importance.
[
4
]
[
13
]
The Pete initially developed as a pedestrian precinct with the public spaces evolving with
bazaar
streets, temple
squares
, lakes and maidans (open grounds). But, under the
Wodeyars
' rule, during the
British Raj
, in the 19th century, public gardens developed along with the suburbs, adjoining the traditional Pete, following western planning concepts with wider roads. The streets were built in a gridiron pattern and designed to cater to heavy vehicular traffic.
[
1
]
[
13
]
During the colonial rule the British expanded the Pete, to include the
cantonment
to position their
garrison
, which was separated by an 11.5 kilometres (7 mi) wide strip of open land. The colonial city by coincidence decongested the old native city (Pete) and also provided much needed green 'lung space'.
[
13
]
Since then several developments, post independence (1947 till date), have led to the rapid growth of the city.
Old Stories
From the time of Kempegowda, the caste leaders assumed the functions of policing and rendering justice, with inter-caste disputes being usually settled in favor of the upper castes. In the 19th century, when the
Bangalore Cantonment
assumed dominance in terms of size and revenue, care was taken to ensure that there was very little or no contact between the Cantonment areas and the peté, with the
Bangalore Cantonment
being part of the British
Madras Presidency
and the Pete being under the administration of the
Mysore Maharaja
. In 1834, when
Mark Cubbon
, took over as the Commissioner of Mysore, one of his first task was to establish a legal system based on English Common Law, which ran parallel to the caste-based panchayats. With the establishment of the supremacy of the British courts, the significance of the traditional caste-based courts in the peté began to decline.

Nineteenth-century accounts

P Ballahkristnah's description, 1853
[
edit
]
Writing on 7 April 1853, P Ballahkristnah, a Hindu scholar of the Wesleyan Educational Institution, Bangalore, provides a description of the Bangalore Petah. Bangalore is a table-land, offering Europeans travelers from Madras, much relief with the cooler climate. Fruits, vegetables, grains of many varieties grew abundantly. The Bangalore pettah is fully surrounded by tanks, which are artificial lakes used to supply water to the population of the petah. From the outskirts, the Petah looked like it had been recently destroyed by fire and fully de-populated, because of its bare mud walls. However, entering the gates, one finds a bustling city with huge crowds and busy market place. The lanes were narrow, covered with mud and dirt. Drains had been constructed by the Mysore Government at public expense, however, they were badly maintained and seeing bandicoots, rats, carcasses of dead dogs and stagnant water was common. The houses were like dungeons or dark cellars, without any light or ventilation. Singing mosquitoes, poisonous scorpions were common in these native houses. Bargaining was common in the shops, with the vendors quoting different prices for the goods according to how rich or poor the customer looked. Drunkenness was also common in the Bangalore Petah, across all classes of people.
[
15
]
Walker and Walker's account, 1855
[
edit
]
According to the
Gazetteer of Southern India
(1855), the Bangalore Petah is located south west of the
Bangalore Cantonment
at a distance of 1 mile. The population of the petah was 41664. The petah was surrounded by a mud wall and a dry moat which was overgrown with the thorny
Mimosa saponaria
(sekakai) plant. An old hedge measuring 80 yard across, which was a major worry during the British
Siege of Bangalore, 1792
, had been recently cleared off and the ground was built upon. The houses in the Bangalore Petah were flat roofed and the streets were open and had good drainage. The bazaars and the town appeared prosperous. There were two tanks one at the North and the other large one 2 miles to the south, which supplied water. The tank at the south had been destroyed by
Tipu Sultan
, and had been repaired by the British after his fall. Wells around the town, provided good supply of water to the petah. There was a free civil hospital, with an exclusive section for the
Brahmins
. There was also a mental asylum, a lepers' asylum, and a poor house, and a jail was in the process of being built.

Thomas Hodson's account, 1856
[
edit

Thomas Hodson
, in 1856, describes Bangalore as consisting of two parts - the
Cantonment
where the soldiers lived and
Tamil
was primarily spoken, and the Old Town or the native town (Bangalore Pete) where
Canarese
was the main language. In both parts a total of 130,000 Indians lived.
[

Further he describes the shops of the Bangalore petah, with mud being used for the walls and the floor, wooden pillars and clay used for flat roofs. There were no windows or any protection from the dust, with a mat from the rooftop for shade. At night, the shops were secured by wooden shutters. The shop-keeper sat on the floor of the shop, or on one of the lower shelves. The traders were cloth merchants, grocers, gold smiths, etc. The shops sold sugarcane, coconut, bananas, rice, sweets which were hung on a string and various grains which were kept in baskets with were smeared with cow-dung. Water carriers carrying water was a common site. There were thousands of monkeys which created mischief, but were unharmed by the natives due to their religious beliefs.

Wesleyan Village Chapel and School Near Bangalore by
Thomas Hodson
(1859)
[

]
Rice Memorial Church
,
Avenue Road
,
Bangalore
, (2016)
Writing on 24 November 1858, Sarah Sanderson (wife of Rev.
Daniel Sanderson
), describes the Wesleyan Mission School and Chapel in a Pariah village near the Bangalore Petah. The article also carried a sketch of the same, by
Thomas Hodson
. This school had some 30 children, 22 boys and 8 girls. They were taught by John a native catechist. Divine services were held on Sundays in
Canarese
at 7:30AM. The congregation consisted of 8-10 men and 25-30 children, and many others listening from outside the door. However, most seemed to attend out of curiosity of seeing the European ladies and men. The church services commenced by ringing the bell. Further, she describes the social scorn and humiliation suffered by the Pariah community, such as not being allowed to even walk in the street of the high caste people, untouchability practiced for the fear of pollution by lower castes. However, the Europeans readily employed servants from the Pariah communities and their sent to Mission schools, brightening their employment prospects.
[
22
]
Further, Sarah Sanderson, writing on 24 September 1859, describes the pettah as the native town of Bangalore with a population of about 60,000. The petah had nearly 200-300 temples or shrines, whose deities were anointed with oil making them greasy and black, and offered flowers and fruit. The petah now had 2 Christian churches, one was the
London Mission
Canarese Chapel (now
Rice Memorial Church
on
Avenue Road
) and the other was the Canarese Wesleyan Chapel opened a few months before September 1859. To the left of the Wesleyan Chapel was a low building, which had been altered and white-washed to serve as a school. The chapel did not have pews or a gallery. The floor was covered with bamboo matting, and there were rows of benches with seats of fancy cane-work (or rattan). 8 oil lamps using coconut oil were suspended from the ceiling to be used to lighting in the evenings. The windows which were generally kept open had iron bars to keep out the monkeys. Further, she says that her children liked walking the busy streets of the petah to reach the chapel along with their father, observing its noise, local people, shops and the monkeys. Monkeys were numerous in the Petah, and created nuisance by stealing food and other things from people.
Sarah describes some events such as a postman walking up to the pulpit to deliver a letter to the preacher in the middle of his sermon on a Sunday. Another, when the Muslim mourning of '
Moharrum
' was being observed when she attended church one evening. The people used to walk in and out of the chapel as they pleased. All so different from the quiet atmosphere of any Wesleyan Chapel in England.

Present urban status of pete
[
edit
]
The Pete as it exists today
(overlay map)
in the heart of Bangalore Metropolis reported a population of 112,076 persons in a diverse use area (Residential: 37.5%; Commercial: 34.6%; Industrial: 6.1%). The trades which defined the Pete in the past have remained but have enormously prospered with modern trades, as distinct entities with a built-in relationship between occupation and community with deep-rooted traditional patterns of living. An urban infrastructure study reported in a scholarly article by Champaka Rajagopal in the Journal of the Development and Research Organization for Nature Arts has the following remarkable observations.
[

]
The Pete is presently, inhabited mainly by people from the
Muslim
,
Devanga
,
Tigala
,
Marwari
and
Jain
communities.
In the Pete, industrial and trade activities overflow into the streets, and incredibly encroach public space.
Within the Pete precincts, the Gujarati, Marwari and Jain communities from northwestern parts of the country, generally bankers, have gradually diversified their trade from
pearl
market to textile,
garments
, jewellery, paper,
chemists
,
druggists
,
cutlery
, metal, hardware and electrical goods.
Medarpet is home to the more than 500 families of the Rajput Singh community having their Gurudwara Durbar Saheb Sangh built in memory of Shri Charan Singh Gujar. They make household plastic goods, and medarpete is the wholesale market for Plastic house hold goods.
Marwaris of the Pete, for whom families still control inheritance and management of their own businesses, have diversified into several trades -– including assembly of
computers
-– serving new markets.
Muslim communities of Kumbarpet, like the takaras (traders in household
stone
equipment), chapparband (menders of roof
tiles
), sikkalgar (dealers in copper/
brass
vessels) and phuleras (traders of
flowers
) have, over time, diversified into the
construction industry
.
In the Tharagupet area hardware dealers (mostly dominated by Muslims) say that they have benefited greatly by the rise in global markets, particularly in the construction industry.
In spite of diversification of trade and industry, most of the areas within the Pete have retained their strong presence of community based occupations such as:
Avenue Road
(old Doddapet road) retains its traditional trade in garments and textiles, jewellery and
pawn brokering
Krishna Rajendra (KR) Market is known for trade in vegetables,
fruits
,
flowers
, iron and steel
utensils
Sultanpete trades in paper and in Cubbonpete trade is in
textiles
All the above informal industries of the Pete are reported to have generated more jobs for people. The garment industry, in particular, has registered a volume of exports more than Information Technology.
According to the Comprehensive Development Plan (CDP) of Bangalore, 1995 that determines zoning, land use and transport within Bangalore Metropolitan Area (which has zoned 1,306 square kilometres (504 sq mi)  area of the Bangalore Development Authority), has zoned the city into intensely developed (Zone A), moderately developed (Zone B) and sparsely developed (Zone C) areas. The Pete falls within the intensely developed zone.
The existing trends of development in the Pete is of a highly built up area and a population density that has resulted in less liveable conditions
A detail study of the changing socio–economic patterns that could bring about in reality different development patterns, is essential by introducing new building
byelaws
by the
municipal corporation
. Therefore, the Pete skirts through formal enforceable legal systems but continues to develop in an alternative, less liveable way due to strong local politics.
The paper has chronicled the urban planning involving highly intertwined issues of the "pete" succinctly and the conclusion drawn from this study of the Pete is better reflected, as quoted:
"For a place as intricate and complex as the Pete, formulation of regulations through public participation would be sensitive and challenging. Communities, religions and economies have coexisted here but not without tensions… an inclusive methodology would help direct the role of the urban designer as a 'less cavalier' coordinator, addressing diverse disciplines and negotiating the efforts of various groups that shape urban places, especially for informal urban settings such as the Pete."
