BJP slams AAP govt's 'world class education', flags poor condition of MCD school at Kapashera
Delhi BJP leaders on Tuesday slammed the AAP government over its claim of providing "world class education" in the city, alleging they found small children sitting on floor mats at the MCD school in Kapashera that also lacked basic facilities like toilets and drinking water.
The AAP hit back at the BJP alleging the MCD earned the title of "most corrupt department" when it ruled the civic body. The AAP will transform the MCD schools just as it has done with the Delhi government schools, the party asserted in a statement.
A delegation of Delhi BJP, including its president Virendra Sachdeva and South Delhi MP Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, visited the primary school of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) ruled by the AAP.
"The AAP government, which claims to have given a world-class education model to Delhi, has forced hundreds of students in its MCD schools to sit on jute mats in the classes," Sachdeva said after the visit.
He said the BJP will file complaints with the lieutenant governor of Delhi and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) to ensure immediate action for providing basic facilities to the children.

The CBI on Tuesday claimed before a Delhi court that the money generated from the excise "scam" was spent according to the wishes of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who promised Rs 90 lakh to each candidate of his party in the 2022 Goa assembly elections.

He had promised Rs 90 lakh to be given to each candidate of each constituency and there are 40 constituencies in Goa,‚Äù the CBI told the court, which reserved the order on whether to take cognisance of the charge sheet for September 3.

A Delhi court is likely to hear on August 28 an application filed by Lok Sabha MP Rashid Engineer, who is in jail since 2019, seeking regular bail in a 2017 Jammu and Kashmir terror funding case.
Sheikh Abdul Rashid, popularly known as Engineer Rashid, defeated former chief minister and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah in the Baramulla constituency in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.
Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Chander Jit Singh had on August 20 issued notice to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and directed it to file its response by August 28 on his plea.

Three of the criminals were injured during the encounter after being shot in the leg, a police official said.
"A team from Phase-III police station was conducting checks near Garhi Gol Chakkar when they spotted two motorcycles with four people on them.

The accused have been identified as Dhirendra alias Veer Singh from Uttar Pradesh's Hamirpur district, Purushottam from Badaun district, Imran alias Chacha from Amroha district and Sudhir Gupta from Shahjahanpur district.
"Upon realising they were cornered, the criminals opened fire on the police team, who then returned fire. Dhirendra, Purushottam and Imran were injured in the leg, after which all of them were arrested," DCP Avasthi said.
Three country-made pistols, a motorcycle, 14 mobile phones and Rs 8,000 cash were recovered from the arrested accused, he said.
"During interrogation, they revealed that Dhirendra, Purushottam and Imran sold the stolen mobile phones to their accomplice Sudhir Gupta. They also confessed to committing more than 12 robbery incidents in the NCR," the DCP added.

"The DDA contractor has given an email in his affidavit to the Supreme Court in which it is clearly written that the trees will be cut on the instructions of the Lieutenant Governor. On February 13, when the trees were being cut, the forest department officials stopped the trees from being cut. But on February 14, trees were cut without permission," Bharadwaj said.
"The Forest Department, DDA and the Lieutenant Governor knew that there was no permission, yet they got the trees cut. This evidence is exposing the BJP and the Lieutenant Governor today that they are conspiring in Delhi as to how to play with the health of the people of Delhi. How to increase pollution... I am inviting the Lieutenant Governor to come and have an open debate on this issue in front of the public so that people know the truth," Bharadwaj added.

Delhi News Live Updates: BJP MLA moves Delhi HC alleging discrimination in installation of CCTV cameras by AAP govt
A BJP MLA has approached the Delhi High Court alleging discrimination in the installation of CCTV cameras by the Delhi government. The plea claims that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ruled Delhi government installing cameras only in areas represented by AAP MLAs and councillors, while areas represented by BJP MLAs and councillors are being overlooked.
The matter is scheduled to come for a hearing before the bench led by the Acting Chief Justice on August 27.
The petitioner Abhay Verma representing the Laxmi Nagar Assembly Constituency, claims that while Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia announced the installation of 1,40,000 CCTV cameras across Delhi, his constituency was unjustly excluded. The Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) had conducted a survey indicating a need for 2,066 cameras in Laxmi Nagar, but the installation was selectively carried out, benefiting only areas represented by ruling party leaders.
