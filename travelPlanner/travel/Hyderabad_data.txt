ISO

Haidarābād
) is the capital and largest city of the
Indian state
of
Telangana
. It occupies 650 km
2
(250 sq mi) on the
Deccan Plateau
along the banks of the
Musi River
, in the northern part of Southern India. With an average altitude of 542 m (1,778 ft), much of Hyderabad is situated on hilly terrain around
artificial lakes
, including the
Hussain Sagar
lake, predating the city's founding, in the north of the city centre. According to the
2011 census of India
, Hyderabad is the
fourth-most populous city in India
with a population of
6.9 million
residents within the city limits, and has a population of
9.7 million
residents in the
metropolitan region
, making it the
sixth-most populous metropolitan area
in India. With an output of
US$
95 billion
[
6
]
[
7
]
, Hyderabad has the sixth-largest urban economy in India.
The Qutb Shahi dynasty's
Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah
established Hyderabad in 1591 to extend the capital beyond the
fortified Golconda
. In 1687,
the city was annexed
by the
Mughals
. In 1724,
Asaf Jah I
, the
Mughal viceroy
, declared his sovereignty and founded the
Asaf Jahi dynasty
, also known as the
Nizams
. Hyderabad served as the imperial capital of the Asaf Jahis from 1769 to 1948. As capital of the
princely state of Hyderabad
, the city housed the
British Residency
and
cantonment
until
Indian independence
in 1947.
Hyderabad was annexed
by the
Indian Union
in 1948 and continued as a capital of
Hyderabad State
from 1948 to 1956. After
the introduction
of the
States Reorganisation Act of 1956
, Hyderabad was made the capital of the
newly formed Andhra Pradesh
. In 2014,
Andhra Pradesh was split
to form the state of Telangana, and Hyderabad became the joint capital of the two states with a transitional arrangement scheduled to end in 2024.
[
8
]
Since 1956, the city has housed the
Rashtrapati Nilayam
, the winter office of the
president of India
.
Relics of the Qutb Shahi and Nizam eras remain visible today; the
Charminar
has come to symbolise the city. By the end of the early modern era, the Mughal Empire had declined in the Deccan, and the Nizam's patronage attracted men of letters from various parts of the world.
A distinctive culture
arose from the amalgamation of local and migrated artisans, with
painting
,
handicraft
,
jewellery
,
literature
,
dialect
and
clothing
prominent even today. For
its cuisine
, the city is listed as a
creative city of gastronomy
by
UNESCO
. The
Telugu film industry
based in the city is the highest-grossing film industry in India as of 2021
[update]
.
Until the
19th century
, Hyderabad was known for the
pearl industry
and was nicknamed the "City of Pearls", and was the only trading centre for
Golconda diamonds
in the world. Many of the city's historical and traditional
bazaars
remain open. Hyderabad's central location between the
Deccan Plateau
and the
Western Ghats
, and industrialisation throughout the
20th century
attracted major Indian research, manufacturing, educational and financial institutions. Since the 1990s, the city has emerged as an
Indian hub of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology
and information technology. The formation of the
special economic zones
of
Hardware Park
and
HITEC City
, dedicated to information technology, has encouraged leading multinationals to set up operations in Hyderabad.

History of Hyderabad
Toponymy
The name
Hyderabad
means "Haydar's City" or "Lion City", from
haydar
'lion' and
ābād
'city', after
Caliph
Ali Ibn Abi Talib
, also known as Haydar because of his lion-like valour in battle.
[
9
]
The city was originally called
Baghnagar
("city of gardens"
[
10
]
), and later acquired the name
Hyderabad
.
[
10
]
[
11
]
The European travellers
von Poser
and
Thévenot
found both names in use in the 17th century.

[

A popular legend suggests that the founder of the city,
Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah
, named it
Bhagya-nagar
("fortunate city"
[
15
]
) after
Bhagmati
, a local
nautch
(dancing) girl whom he married. She converted to
Islam
and adopted the title
Hyder Mahal
. The city would have been named
Hyderabad
in her honour.
[

[
16
]
In the year 1597, Hyderabad gained the
epithet
Farkhunda Bunyad
(
lit.
'
Of Auspicious Foundation
'
). Following the
Mughal conquest of Hyderabad
, emperor
Aurangzeb
changed the epithet to
Dar-ul-Jihad
(
lit.
'
Abode of Holy War
'
), a title which appears on coins minted in the city during the reigns of Aurangzeb and
Kam Bakhsh
. The later Mughal emperor
Shah Alam
returned the city to its older epithet of
Farkhunda Bunyad
, and consequently Mughal coins of Shah Alam and
Muhammad Shah
feature this title as the city's mint-name.

Following the dissolution of the Chalukya empire into four parts in the 11th century, Golconda—now part of Hyderabad—came under the control of the
Kakatiya dynasty
from 1158, whose seat of power was at
Warangal
—148 km (92 mi) northeast of modern Hyderabad.
[
23
]
The Kakatiya ruler
Ganapatideva
(1199–1262) built a
hilltop
outpost
—later known as
Golconda Fort
—to defend their western region.
[

The Kakatiya dynasty was reduced to a vassal of the
Khalji dynasty
in 1310 after its defeat by Sultan
Alauddin Khalji
of the
Delhi Sultanate
. This lasted until 1321, when the Kakatiya dynasty was annexed by
Malik Kafur
, Khalji's general.
[

During this period, Khalji took the
Koh-i-Noor
diamond, which is said to have been mined from the
Kollur Mines
of Golconda, to Delhi.
[

Muhammad bin Tughluq
succeeded to the Delhi sultanate in 1325, bringing Warangal under the rule of the
Tughlaq dynasty
;
Malik Maqbul Tilangani
was appointed its governor. In 1336 the regional chieftains
Musunuri Nayakas
—who revolted against the Delhi sultanate in 1333—took Warangal under their direct control and declared it as their capital.
[
26
]
In 1347 when
Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah
, a governor under bin Tughluq, rebelled against Delhi and established the
Bahmani Sultanate
in the
Deccan Plateau
, with
Gulbarga
—200 km (124 mi) west of Hyderabad—as its capital, both the neighbouring rulers Musunuri Nayakas of Warangal and Bahmani Sultans of Gulbarga engaged in many wars until 1364–65 when a peace treaty was signed and the Musunuri Nayakas ceded Golconda Fort to the Bahmani Sultan. The Bahmani Sultans ruled the region until 1518 and were the first independent Muslim rulers of the Deccan.

On 21 September 1687, the Golconda Sultanate came under the rule of the
Mughal emperor
Aurangzeb
after a
year-long siege

Mughal rule in Hyderabad was administered by three main governors:
Jan Sipar Khan
(1688–1700), his son
Rustam Dil Khan
(1700–13) and
Mubariz Khan
(1713–24).

Modern history
In 1713, Mughal emperor
Farrukhsiyar
appointed
Mubariz Khan
as Governor of Hyderabad. During his tenure, he
fortified the city
and controlled the internal and neighbouring threats.
[
41

In 1714 Farrukhsiyar appointed
Asaf Jah I
as
Viceroy of the Deccan
—(administrator of six Mughal governorates) with the title
Nizam-ul-Mulk
(Administrator of the Realm). In 1721, he was appointed as Prime Minister of the
Mughal Empire
.
[
42
]
His differences with the court nobles led him to resign from all the imperial responsibilities in 1723 and leave for Deccan.
[
43
]
[
44
]
Under the influence of Asaf Jah I's opponents, Mughal Emperor
Muhammad Shah
issued a decree to
Mubariz Khan
, to stop Asaf Jah I which resulted in the
Battle of Shakar Kheda
.
[
43
]
: 93–94
In 1724, Asaf Jah I defeated Mubariz Khan to establish autonomy over the
Deccan
, named the region
Hyderabad Deccan
, and started what came to be known as the
Asaf Jahi dynasty
. Subsequent rulers retained the title
Nizam ul-Mulk
and were referred to as Asaf Jahi Nizams, or
Nizams of Hyderabad
.
[

The death of Asaf Jah I in 1748 resulted in a period of political unrest as his sons and grandson—
Nasir Jung
(1748–1750),
Muzaffar Jang
(1750–1751) and
Salabat Jung
(1751–1762)—contended for the throne backed by opportunistic neighbouring states and colonial foreign forces. The accession of
Asaf Jah II
, who reigned from 1762 to 1803, ended the instability. In 1768 he signed the
Treaty of Masulipatam
—by which the
East India Company
in return for a fixed annual rent, got the right to control and collect the taxes at
Coromandel Coast
.

In 1769 Hyderabad city became the formal capital of the Asaf Jahi Nizams.

(
Peshwa
of the
Maratha Empire
), and Basalath Jung (Asaf Jah II's elder brother, who was supported by
French
General the
Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau

subsidiary alliance
with the East India Company in 1798, allowing the
British Indian Army
to be stationed at
Bolarum
(modern
Secunderabad
) to protect the state's capital, for which the Nizams paid an annual maintenance to the British.

Until 1874 there were no modern industries in Hyderabad. With the introduction of railways in the 1880s, four factories were built to the south and east of
Hussain Sagar

and during the early 20th century, Hyderabad was transformed into a modern city with the establishment of transport services, underground drainage, running water,
electricity

The Hyderabad State Congress, with the support of the
Indian National Congress

Nizam VII
in 1948. On 17 September that year, the Indian Army took control of Hyderabad State after an invasion codenamed
Operation Polo

On 1 November 1956 the states of India
were reorganised
by language. Hyderabad state was split into three parts, which were merged with neighbouring states to form
Maharashtra

Makkah Masjid

Hyderabad emerged as the foremost centre of culture in India with the decline of the
Mughal Empire
. After the
fall of Delhi in 1857
, the migration of performing artists to the city particularly from the north and west of the
Indian subcontinent
, under the patronage of the Nizam, enriched the cultural milieu.
[
205
]
[
206
]
This migration resulted in a mingling of North and South Indian languages, cultures and religions, which has since led to a
co-existence of Hindu and Muslim traditions
, for which the city has become noted.
[
207
]
[
208
]
: viii
A further consequence of this north–south mix is that both
Telugu
and
Urdu
are official languages of Telangana.
[
209
]
The mixing of religions has resulted in many festivals being celebrated in Hyderabad such as
Ganesh Chaturthi
,
Diwali
and
Bonalu
of Hindu tradition and
Eid ul-Fitr
and
Eid al-Adha
by Muslims.

Most Muslim women wear

In addition to the traditional Hindu and Muslim garments, increasing exposure to western cultures has led to a rise in the wearing of
western style clothing
among youths.
[
215
]
Literature
In the past,
Qutb Shahi
rulers and
Asaf Jahi Nizams
attracted artists, architects, and men of letters from different parts of the world through patronage. The resulting ethnic mix popularised cultural events such as
mushairas
(poetic symposia),
Qawwali
(devotional songs) and
Dholak ke Geet
(traditional folk songs).
[
216
]
[

]
[

The Qutb Shahi dynasty particularly encouraged the growth of
Deccani literature
leading to works such as the
Deccani Masnavi
and
Diwan poetry
, which are among the earliest available manuscripts in Urdu.
[
219
]
Lazzat Un Nisa
, a book compiled in the 15th century at Qutb Shahi courts, contains erotic paintings with diagrams for secret medicines and stimulants in the eastern form of ancient sexual arts.
[

The reign of the
Asaf Jahi Nizams
saw many literary reforms and the introduction of Urdu as a language of court, administration and education.
[

In 1824, a collection of Urdu
Ghazal
poetry, named
Gulzar-e-Mahlaqa
, authored by
Mah Laqa Bai
—the first female Urdu poet to produce a Diwan—was published in Hyderabad.

Hyderabad has continued with these traditions in its annual

South Indian music
and dances such as the

styles are popular in the Deccan region. As a result of their culture policies,
North Indian music
and dance gained popularity during the rule of the Mughals and Nizams,
[
226
]
and it was also during their reign that it became a tradition among the nobility to associate themselves with
tawaif
(courtesans). These courtesans were revered as the epitome of etiquette and culture, and were appointed to teach singing, poetry, and classical dance to many children of the aristocracy.
[
227

This gave rise to certain styles of court music, dance and poetry. Besides
western
and Indian popular music genres such as
filmi
music, the residents of Hyderabad play city-based
marfa music
,
Dholak ke Geet
(household songs based on local
folklore

The region is well known for its Golconda and Hyderabad painting styles which are branches of
Deccan painting
.
[
240

Developed during the 16th century, the Golconda style is a native style blending foreign techniques and bears some similarity to the
Vijayanagara paintings
of neighbouring Mysore. A significant use of luminous gold and white colours is generally found in the Golconda style.
[
241

The Hyderabad style originated in the 17th century under the Nizams. Highly influenced by
Mughal painting
, this style makes use of bright colours and mostly depicts regional landscape, culture, costumes, and jewellery.
[
240

Although not a centre for handicrafts itself, the patronage of the arts by the Mughals and Nizams attracted artisans from the region to Hyderabad. Such crafts include:
Wootz steel

Filigree work
,
Bidriware
, a metalwork handicraft from neighbouring
Karnataka

Perhaps there is no city in India with a population so varied or so warlike as that of Hyderabad. Every man goes about armed with a weapon of some kind, while the military classes are literally armed to the teeth. Here may be seen the Arab, the Siddi, the Rohilla, the Pathan, the Mahratta, the Turk, the Sikh, Persians, Parsis, Madrasis, Negroes, and others.

The collectorate administers the district on behalf of the state government. The Hyderabad District does not have elected officials at the district level due to the absence of a
Zilla Parishad
(District Legislature) although it has representations at the state (
MLA
) and Union level
legislature
(
MP
). In addition the entire district is contained within the jurisdiction of the
GHMC
, the city administration. Representatives are popularly elected to various wards of GHMC.

Hyderabad State

[

was a kingdom, country, and
princely state
in the
Deccan
with its capital at the city of
Hyderabad
. It is now divided into the state of
Telangana
, the
Kalyana-Karnataka
region of
Karnataka
, and the
Marathwada region
of
Maharashtra
in present-day
India
, which annexed it in 1948.
The state was ruled from 1724 to 1948  by the
Nizam
, who was initially a
viceroy
of the
Mughal empire
in the
Deccan
. Hyderabad gradually became the first princely state to come under
British paramountcy
signing a
subsidiary alliance
agreement. During the British rule in 1901, the state had a revenue of
₹
4,17,00,000.

The dynasty declared itself an independent monarchy during the final years of the
British Raj

Partition of India
, Hyderabad signed a
standstill agreement
with the new
dominion of India
, continuing all previous arrangements except for the stationing of Indian troops in the state. Hyderabad's location in the middle of the Indian Union, as well as its diverse cultural heritage, led to
India's annexation
of the state in 1948.

Early history
[
edit
]
Hyderabad State was founded by
Mir Qamar-ud-din Khan
who was the governor of Deccan under the
Mughals
from 1713 to 1721. In 1724, he resumed rule from the Mughal provincial capital of Aurangabad, under the title of
Asaf Jah
(granted by Mughal Emperor
Muhammad Shah
). His other title,
Nizam ul-Mulk
(Order of the Realm), became the title of his position "Nizam of Hyderabad". By the end of his rule, the Nizam had become independent from the Mughals, and had founded the
Asaf Jahi dynasty
.
[
14
]
[
15
]
Following the decline of the Mughal power, the region of Deccan saw the rise of the
Maratha Empire
. The Nizam himself saw many invasions by the Marathas in the 1720s, which resulted in the Nizam paying a regular
Chauth
(tax) to the Marathas. The major battles fought between the Marathas and the Nizam include
Palkhed
,
Rakshasbhuvan
, and
Kharda
.
[
16
]
[
17
]
Following the conquest of Deccan by
Bajirao I
and the imposition of
Chauth
by him, Nizam remained a tributary of the Marathas for all intent and purposes.
[
18
]
In 1763, the Nizam shifted the capital to the city of
Hyderabad
.
[
15
]
From 1778, a British resident and soldiers were installed in his dominions. In 1795, the
Nizam
lost some of his territories to the
Marathas
. The territorial gains of the Nizam from
Mysore
as an ally of the British were ceded to the British to meet the cost of maintaining the British soldiers.

In 1798,
Nizam ʿĀlī Khan
(Asaf
Jah II
) was forced to enter into an agreement that put Hyderabad under British protection. He was the first Indian prince to sign such an agreement. (Consequently, the ruler of Hyderabad rated a 23-gun
salute
during the period of
British India
.)

Hyderabad under
Asaf Jah II
was a British ally in the second and third
Maratha Wars
(1803–05, 1817–19),
Anglo-Mysore wars
, and would remain loyal to the British during the
Indian Rebellion of 1857
(1857–58).

His son,
Asaf Jah III Mir Akbar Ali Khan
(known as
Sikandar Jah
) ruled from 1803 to 1829. During his rule, a British cantonment was built in Hyderabad and the area was named in his honour,
Secunderabad

The British Residency at
Koti
was also built during his reign by the then British Resident
James Achilles Kirkpatrick

Asaf Jah V
[

Asaf Jah V
's reign from 1857 to 1869 was marked by reforms by his
Prime Minister
Salar Jung I
. Before this time, there was no regular or systematic form of administration, and the duties were in the hands of the
Diwan
(Prime Minister), and corruption was thus widespread.
[
23
]
In 1867, the State was divided into five divisions and seventeen districts, and subedars (governors) were appointed for the five Divisions and
talukdars
and
tehsildars
for the districts. The judicial, public works, medical, educational, municipal, and police departments were re-organized.
[

In 1868,
sadr-i-mahrams

regents
were
Salar Jung I

Asman Jah
and
Viqar-ul-Umra
. He assumed full rule at the age of 17 and ruled until he died in 1911.

The

The Nizam also established
Hyderabad State Bank
. Hyderabad was the only independent state in
Indian
subcontinent that had its currency, the
Hyderabadi rupee
.
[

The
Begumpet Airport
was established in the 1930s with formation of
Hyderabad Aero Club
by the Nizam. Initially, it was used as a domestic and international airport for Nizam's
Deccan Airways
, the earliest airline in British India. The terminal building was created in 1937.
[
38

To prevent another
great flood
, the Nizam also constructed two lakes, namely the
Osman Sagar
and
Himayath Sagar
. The
Osmania General Hospital
,
Jubilee Hall
,
State Library

Main article:
Operation Polo
In 1947
India
gained independence and
Pakistan
came into existence. The British left the local rulers of the
princely states
the choice of whether to join one or the other or to remain independent. On 11 June 1947, the Nizam issued a declaration to the effect that he had decided not to participate in the Constituent Assembly of either Pakistan or India.
However, the Nizams were Muslim ruling over a predominantly Hindu population.
[
14
]
India insisted that the great majority of residents wanted to join India.
[
41
]
The Nizam was in a weak position as his army numbered only 24,000 men, of whom only some 6,000 were fully trained and equipped.
[

On 21 August 1948, the Secretary-General of the Hyderabad Department of External Affairs requested the President of the United Nations Security Council, under Article 35(2) of the
United Nations Charter
, to consider the "grave dispute, which, unless settled by
international law
and justice, is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security".

announced to the Hyderabad Assembly that a delegation was about to leave for
Lake Success

.
[

The Nizam also appealed, without success, to the British
Labour Government
and to
the King
for assistance, to fulfil their obligations and promises to Hyderabad by "immediate intervention". Hyderabad only had the support of
Winston Churchill
and the British
Conservatives

At 4 a.m. on 13 September 1948, India's Hyderabad Campaign, code-named "
Operation Polo
" by the
Indian Army
, began. Indian troops invaded Hyderabad from all points of the compass. On 13 September 1948, the Secretary-General of the Hyderabad Department of External Affairs in a cablegram informed the United Nations Security Council that Hyderabad was being invaded by Indian forces and that hostilities had broken out. The Security Council took notice of it on 16 September in Paris. The representative of Hyderabad called for immediate action by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. The Hyderabad representative responded to India's excuse for the intervention by pointing out that the Stand-still Agreement between the two countries had expressly provided that nothing in it should give India the right to send in troops to assist in the maintenance of internal order.

Wilfred Cantwell Smith
states that Hyderabad was an area where the political and social structure from medieval Muslim rule had been preserved more or less intact into modern times.
[
55
]
The last Nizam was reputed to be the wealthiest man in the world.
[
56
]
He was supported by an
aristocracy
of 1,100 feudal lords who owned a further 30% of the state's land, with some 4 million tenant farmers. The state also owned 50% or more of the capital in all the major enterprises, allowing the Nizam to earn further profits and control their affairs.
[
57
]
Next in the social structure were the administrative and official classes, comprising about 1,500 officials. A number of them were recruited from outside the state. The lower-level government employees were also predominantly Muslim. Effectively, the Muslims of Hyderabad represented an 'upper caste' of the social structure.
[
58
]
[
a
]
All power was vested in the Nizam. He ruled with the help of an Executive Council or Cabinet, established in 1893, whose members he was free to appoint and dismiss. The government of the Nizam recruited heavily from the North Indian Hindu
Kayastha
caste for administrative posts.
[
59
]
There was also an Assembly, whose role was mostly advisory. More than half of its members were appointed by the Nizam and the rest were elected from a carefully limited franchise. There were representatives of Hindus,
Parsis
, Christians and Depressed Classes in the Assembly. Their influence was however limited due to their small numbers.
[
60
]
[
61
]
The state government also had a large number of outsiders (called
non-mulkhis
) – 46,800 of them in 1933, including all the members of the Nizam's Executive Council. Hindus and Muslims united in protesting against the practice which robbed the locals of government employment. The movement, however, fizzled out after the Hindu members raised the issue of 'responsible government', which was of no interest to the Muslim members and led to their resignation.
[
62
]
Various properties and wealth owned by the Nizam as part of Hyderabad State are now succeeded by his descendants, including his grandsons Prince Mukarram Jah, Prince  Mufakkam Jah & Prince Shahmat Jah and his great-grandson Himayat Ali Mirza among others.
[
63
]
[
64
]
Himayat Ali Mirza, great-grandson of the Nizam, remarked that his stake in the English state sums up to 36% of the total amount.
[
63
]
For claiming the total share of £35 million, Nizam's great-grandson, Himayat Ali Mirza, reached the London High Court.
[
65
]
Political movements
[
edit
]
Up to 1920, there was no political organisation of any kind in Hyderabad. In that year, following British pressure, the Nizam issued a
firman
appointing a special officer to investigate constitutional reforms. It was welcomed enthusiastically by a section of the populace, who formed the Hyderabad State Reforms Association. However, the Nizam and the Special Officer ignored all their demands for consultation. Meanwhile, the Nizam banned the
Khilafat movement
in the State as well as all political meetings and the entry of "political outsiders". Nevertheless, some political activity did take place and witnessed cooperation between Hindus and Muslims. The abolition of the Sultanate in Turkey and Gandhi's suspension of the
Non-co-operation movement
in British India ended this period of cooperation.
[
61
]
An organisation called
Andhra Jana Sangham
(later renamed
Andhra Mahasabha
) was formed in November 1921 and focused on educating the masses of
Telangana
in political awareness. With leading members such as
Madapati Hanumantha Rao
,
Burgula Ramakrishna Rao
and M. Narsing Rao, its activities included urging merchants to resist offering freebies to government officials and encouraging labourers to resist the system of
begar
(free labour requested at the behest of state). Alarmed by its activities, the Nizam passed a powerful gagging order in 1929, requiring all public meetings to obtain prior permission. But the organisation persisted by mobilising on social issues such as the protection of
ryots
, women's rights, abolition of the
devadasi
system and
purdah
, uplifting of
Dalits
etc. It turned to politics again in 1937, passing a resolution calling for responsible government. Soon afterwards, it split along the moderate–extremist lines. The Andhra Mahasabha's move towards politics also inspired similar movements in
Marathwada
and
Karnataka
in 1937, giving rise to the
Maharashtra Parishad
and
Karnataka Parishad
respectively.

Hyderabad's first ruler,
Asaf Jah I
(r. 1724–1748) was a talented commander and assembled a powerful army that allowed Hyderabad to become one of the preeminent states in southern India.
[
66

After his death, the military was crippled by the succession wars of his sons. It was restored under
Asaf Jah II
(r. 1762–1803) who modernized the army.

Notable units during his reign included

The
National Anthem of Nizam's Dominion
, better known as "O Osman", was the national anthem of the Hyderabad State until its
annexation
by
India
. It was composed by John Frederick during the time of 7th Nizam
Mir Osman Ali Khan
and the lyrics are as follows.
May the creator bless the kingdom till eternity,
And O! Osman, keep you sound and healthy.
And make you live with dignity for a hundred years,
By the grace of God you are the pride of rulers.
May the Almighty keep your rule illustrious,
May God grant long life like khizr to your children.
And maintain the continuity of your noble descent,
May the proverbial Hatim’s charity pale before yours.
May your sense of justice surpass even that of Khusro,
and May your wellwishers glow like full-blown flowers.
And your enemies acknowledge your superior prowess,
O! Osman, make your tavern an abode of joy and ecstasy.

Architecture
[

The architecture of Hyderabad State is very cosmopolitan, and heavily influenced by European and Islamic styles. The Nizam's palaces and several public buildings were built in a distinctive style. The earliest surviving buildings are purely European, examples being the
neoclassical
British Residency
(1798) and
Falaknuma Palace
(1893). In the early 20th century, the
Osmania General Hospital
[
76

City College
,
High Court
, and
Kacheguda Railway station
were designed in the
Indo-Saracenic
style by
Vincent Esch
