is the
capital city
of
Tamil Nadu
, the southernmost
state of India
. It is the state's
primate city
and is located on the
Coromandel Coast
of the
Bay of Bengal
. According to the
2011 Indian census
, Chennai is the
sixth-most populous city
in India and forms the
fourth-most populous urban agglomeration
. Incorporated in 1688, the
Greater Chennai Corporation
is the oldest
municipal corporation
in India and the second oldest in the world after
London
.
Historically, the region was part of the
Chola
,
Pandya
,
Pallava
and
Vijayanagara
kingdoms during various eras. The coastal land which then contained the fishing village Madrasapattinam, was purchased by the
British East India Company
from the
Nayak
ruler
Chennapa Nayaka
in the 17th century. The British garrison established the Madras city and
port
and built
Fort St. George
, the first British fortress in India. The city was made the winter capital of the
Madras Presidency
, a
colonial
province of the
British Raj
in the
Indian subcontinent
. After
India gained independence
in 1947, Madras continued as the capital city of the
Madras State
and present-day Tamil Nadu. The city was officially
renamed
as Chennai in 1996.
The city is coterminous with
Chennai district
, which together with the adjoining suburbs constitutes the
Chennai Metropolitan Area
,
[
c
]
the
35th-largest urban area in the world by population
and one of the largest metropolitan economies of India. Chennai has the
fifth-largest urban economy
and the third-largest
expatriate
population in India. As a gateway to South India, Chennai is among the most-visited Indian cities ranking 36th among the most-visited cities in the world in 2019. Ranked as a beta-level city in the
Global Cities Index
, Chennai regularly features among the best cities to live in India and is amongst the safest cities in India.
Chennai is a major centre for
medical tourism
and is termed "India's health capital". Chennai houses a major portion of India's automobile industry, hence the name "
Detroit
of India". It was the only South Asian city to be ranked among
National Geographic
's "Top 10 food cities" in 2015 and ranked ninth on
Lonely Planet
's best cosmopolitan cities in the world. In October 2017, Chennai was added to the
UNESCO
Creative Cities Network (UCCN) list. It is a major
film production
centre and home to the
Tamil-language film industry
.
Etymology

Names of Chennai in different languages
The name
Chennai
was derived from the name of
Chennappa Nayaka
, a
Nayak
ruler who served as a general under
Venkata Raya
of the
Vijayanagara Empire
from whom
the British East India Company
acquired the town in 1639.
[
11
]
[
12
]
The first official use of the name was in August 1639 in a sale deed to
Francis Day
of the East India Company.
[
13
]
A land grant was given to the
Chennakesava Perumal Temple
in Chennapatanam later in 1646, which some scholars argue to be the first use of the name.
[
14
]
[
11
]
The name
Madras
is of native origin, and has been shown to have been in use before the British established a presence in India.
[
15
]
A Vijayanagara-era inscription found in 2015 was dated to the year 1367 and mentions the port of Mādarasanpattanam, along with other small ports on the east coast, and it was theorized that the aforementioned port is the fishing port of
Royapuram
.
[
16
]
Madras
might have been derived from Madraspattinam, a fishing village north of
Fort St. George
but it is uncertain whether the name was in use before the arrival of Europeans.
[
17
]
In July 1996, the
Government of Tamil Nadu
officially
changed
the name from Madras to Chennai.
[

The name "Madras" continues to be used occasionally for the city as well as for places or things named after the city in the past.

by the
French
under General

Mauritius
, who plundered the town and its outlying villages.

Great Trigonometrical Survey of India
, which was started on 10 April 1802.

With the advent of
railways in India
in the 19th century, the city was connected to other major cities such as
Bombay

After
India gained its independence
in 1947, the city became the capital of
Madras State

The city was the location of the hunger strike and death of
Potti Sreeramulu

Andhra State
in 1953 and eventually the
re-organization of Indian states
based on linguistic boundaries in 1956.

In 1965,
agitations
against the
imposition of Hindi

Geography
Main article:
Geography of Chennai
Satellite image of Chennai
Chennai is located on the
southeastern coast
of India in the northeastern part of Tamil Nadu on a flat coastal plain known as the
Eastern Coastal Plains
with an average elevation of 6.7 m (22 ft) and highest point at 60 m (200 ft).
[
46
]
[
47
]
Chennai's soil is mostly
clay
,
shale
and
sandstone
.
[
48
]
Clay underlies most of the city with sandy areas found along the river banks and coasts where rainwater
runoff
percolates
quickly through the soil. Certain areas in South Chennai have a hard rock surface.
[
49
]
[
50
]
As of 2018, the city had a green cover of 14.9 per cent, with a per capita green cover of 8.5 square metres against the
World Health Organization
recommendation of nine square metres.
[
51
]
As of 2017
[update]
, water bodies cover an estimated 3.2 km
2
(1.2 sq mi) area of the city.
[
52
]
Two major rivers flow through Chennai, the
Cooum River
(or
Koovam
) through the centre and the
Adyar River
to the south.
[
53
]
A section of the
Buckingham Canal
built in 1877-78, runs parallel to the Bay of Bengal coast, linking the two rivers.
[
54
]
Kosasthalaiyar River
traverses through the northern fringes of the city before draining into the Bay of Bengal, at
Ennore Creek
.
[
55
]
The
Otteri Nullah
, an east–west stream, runs through north Chennai and meets the Buckingham Canal at
Basin Bridge
.
[
56
]
The
groundwater table
in Chennai is at 4–5 m (13–16 ft) below ground level on average and is replenished mainly by rainwater.
[
57
]
Of the 24.87 km (15.45 mi) coastline of the city, 3.08 km (1.91 mi) experiences erosion, with sand accretion along the shoreline at the
Marina beach
and the area between the
Ennore Port
and
Kosasthalaiyar river
.
[
58
]
Geology
Chennai is situated in
Seismic Zone III
, indicating a moderate risk of damage from
earthquakes
.
[
59
]
Owing to the tectonic zone the city falls in, the city is considered a potential
geothermal energy
site. The
crust
has old granite rocks dating back nearly a billion years indicating volcanic activities in the past with expected temperatures of 200–300 °C (392–572 °F) at 4–5 km (2.5–3.1 mi) depth.
[
60
]
Climate
Chennai has a dry-summer
tropical wet and dry climate
which is designated
As
under the
Köppen climate classification
.
[
61
]
The city lies on the
thermal equator
and as it is also located on the coast, there is no extreme variation in seasonal temperature.
[
62
]
The hottest time of the year is from April to June with an average temperature of 35–40 °C (95–104 °F).
[
63
]
The highest recorded temperature was 45 °C (113 °F) on 31 May 2003.
[
64
]
The coldest time of the year is in December–January, with average temperature of 19–25 °C (66–77 °F) and the lowest recorded temperature of 13.9 °C (57.0 °F) on 11 December 1895 and 29 January 1905.
[
65
]
Chennai receives most of its rainfall from the
northeast monsoon
between October and December while smaller amounts of rain come from the
southwest monsoon
between June and September. The average annual rainfall is about 120 cm (47 in).
[
66
]
The highest annual rainfall recorded was 257 cm (101 in) in 2005.
[
67
]
Prevailing winds in Chennai are usually southwesterly between April and October and northeasterly during the rest of the year.
[
68
]
The city relies on the annual monsoon rains to replenish water reservoirs.
[
69
]
Cyclones and depressions
are common features during the season.
[
70
]
Water inundation and flooding happen in low-lying areas during the season with significant flooding in
2015
and
2023

.
[

]
[
36
]
[
37
]
It functions from the Air Traffic Control Complex within the airport.
[
38
]
The airport is the centre of the southern
flight information region
(FIR), one of the four FIRs that the Indian air space is divided into and is responsible for the air traffic services over the Chennai FIR consisting of five southern states and two southern union territories and the oceanic air space of the southern part of the
Bay of Bengal
and the eastern part of the
Arabian Sea
.
[

]
The immigration services at the airport are handled by the Bureau of Immigration of the
Ministry of Home Affairs
.
[
40
]
The airport is the home to the southern regional office of the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS), which is responsible for the security of flights.
[
41
]
Security of the airport is provided by the
Airport Sector (CISF)
, that includes a
dog squad
for identification of
narcotics
and
bomb disposal
.
[

In 2013,
Government of India
proposed to offer a contract to a private operator to operate the airport and AAI invited bids for the same.
[
44
]
[
45
]
The plan did not materialise due to protest by airport employees against the move fearing job losses.

Runways

Aerial view showing the primary runway (left) and the secondary runway
The airport has two runways — the 3,661 m (12,011 ft) long primary runway 07/25 (Northeast – Southwest orientation) and the 2,890 m (9,480 ft) long secondary runway 12/30 (Northwest – Southeast orientation).
[
47
]
[
48
]
The runways are equipped with CAT-I
Instrument Landing System
(ILS) for
IFR
approach with
Precision Approach Path Indicator
(PAPI) landing aids.
[
49
]
An upgraded ILS was installed on runway 07/25 in 2017.
[
50
]
As the airport is not equipped with a
CAT-III
landing system, which will enable operations in poor visibility conditions, disruptions in flight operations happen in poor weather conditions.
[
51
]
In 2012, AAI acquired additional land to install new landing lights and upgrade the ILS.
[
52
]
Primary runway 07/25 approaching from the north-east
The secondary runway (12/30) was closed in 2009 to extend it over the
Adyar River
by means of a bridge over the watercourse at a cost of
₹
4,300 million
(US$52 million). The runway which was initially 2,035 m (6,677 ft) long was planned to be extended to 3,445 m (11,302 ft).
[
53
]
The expansion was completed in March 2011.
[
54
]
The bridge over the Adyar river accommodated the runway and a taxiway, making Chennai airport the first international airport in India to have a runway across a river.
[
55
]
The commissioning was delayed due to work on
landing lights
and
VOR
antenna.
[
56
]
In February 2012, airport authorities announced that only about 2,160 m (7,090 ft) of the secondary runway would be operational due to displacements at both ends and the runway which was earlier used by only smaller aircraft, would be able to accommodate
narrow body aircraft
.
[
57
]

The layout consists of a long taxiway (B) and a shorter taxiway (R) parallel to primary runway 07/25 and parallel taxiway (N) oriented along the secondary runway 12/30. Two taxiways (P and Q) linked the two runways. Apart from the primary taxiways, other secondary taxiways interconnect the runways, main taxiways and parking aprons.
[
47
]
[
58
]
In January 2018, the airport began cross-runway operations to reduce flight delays.
[
59
]
In May 2023, a rapid exit taxi way was added 1,831 m (6,007 ft) from the threshold on the primary runway 07 and another taxi way linking the main apron.
[
60
]
This reduced the runway occupancy time and helped with the plan to increase in flight handling capacity from 36 to 45 flights per hour.

Passenger terminals
[
edit
]
The airport occupies an area of 1,301 acres (526 ha) with the passenger terminals located in

Chennai district
, formerly known as
Madras district
,
[
a
]
is one of the
38 districts
in the
state
of
Tamil Nadu
,
India
. It is the smallest and the most densely populated district in the state. The district is coterminous with the city of
Chennai
, which is administered by the
Greater Chennai Corporation
. It is surrounded by
Tiruvallur district
in the north and the west,
Kanchipuram district
in the south-west,
Chenglpattu district
in the south, and the
Bay of Bengal
in the east.
As of 2011, the district had a population of 67,48,026 with a sex-ratio of 989 females for every 1,000 males.
[
5
]
Much of the district's population descended from its settlements in the 1st century CE to the
Middle Ages
, but the diversity has grown much since then. The district consists of only one civic body, the
megacity
of Chennai, which forms the core and the most notable portion of the much bigger Chennai
metropolis
, or officially, the
Chennai Metropolitan Area
. In 2018, the district's limits were expanded, aligning with that of the newly expanded Greater Chennai Corporation, which had annexed adjacent municipalities. It resulted in the area being increased from 175 square kilometres (68 sq mi) to 426 square kilometres (164 sq mi).
[

[

The district is divided into three
revenue divisions
and ten
taluks

Geography
[
edit
]
Chennai district covers an area of 426 km
2
located on the
Eastern Coastal Plains
of India. It is situated on the northeastern corner of Tamil Nadu along the
Coramandel coast
, a region bounded by the
Bay of Bengal
and is surrounded inland by the districts of
Tiruvallur
,
Kanchipuram
and
Chengalpattu
. It lies between 12°59' and 13°9' of the northern
latitude
and 80°12' and 80°19' of the eastern
longitude
at an average
altitude
of 6 metres above
sea level
on a 'sandy shelving breaker swept' beach. Terrain slope varies from 1:5000 to 1:10,000.
[
9
]
The terrain is very flat with contours ranging from 2 m to 10 m above
mean sea level
with a few isolated hillocks in the southwest beyond the district limits at
St. Thomas Mount
,
Pallavaram
and
Tambaram
.
[
10
]
The district runs inland in a rugged semi-circular fashion and its coastline is about 25.60 km (2.5% of the total coastline of Tamil Nadu). Because of its strategic location and economic importance, it is referred to as the "Gateway of South India." The drainage system includes two
rivers
, namely,
Cooum
(flowing in the northern part) and
Adyar
(flowing in the southern part), a
canal
(the
Buckingham
), and a
stream
(the
Otteri Nullah
) slicing the district into several islands.
The district falls under
Seismic Zone III
indicating a moderate risk of
earthquake
. Geologically the district is divided into three regions, namely, sandy, clayey and hard-rock regions. The
soil
comprises
clay
,
shale
and
sandstone
.
[

]
Of the total land area, reserved forests cover 2.71 km
2
and is concentrated in and around the
Guindy National Park
region, one of the few national parks in the world located within a city. The forest cover of the district is as follows:

[

^
Both of these terms are also often used as metonyms for the
Chennai metropolitan area
's trading and financial services industries, which continue a notable history of being largely based in the city. The name Chennai is colloquially used for a far wider area than just the city. Chennai most often denotes the sprawling Chennai metropolis, including parts from the three districts of Tamil Nadu adjacent to the city/district of Chennai itself. This wider usage of Chennai is documented as far back as 1639, when the Madras Municipal Corporation was created.
